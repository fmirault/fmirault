As you will notice in the following points, I'm a passionate iOS Developer, but not only :

* 💻️ I’m currently working at **Malt** on the iOS Freelancer application
* 🌱 I’m currently learning **SwiftUI** (so many great things to learn...)
* 💬 You can ask me about anything related to iOS code, magic tricks (yes I'm also a **magician**) or even video games (my 3 favourites games of all time : **The Binding of Isaac**, **Secret of Mana**, **Final Fantasy VII**)
